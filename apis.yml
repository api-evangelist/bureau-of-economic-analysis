  The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis is your source of accurate and objective
  data about the nation's economy. BEA's economists produce some of the world's
  most closely watched statistics, including U.S. gross domestic product, better
  known as GDP. We do state and local numbers, too, plus foreign trade and
  investment stats and industry data.
